Nutrition assistant Application

ABSTRACT -
    It can be very helpful and improve eating habits to develop app-based nutrient dashboard systems that can evaluate real-time photographs of meals and assess them for nutritional content. The health tracking platform must, like any other nutrition app, have a specific capability set as well as a number of fundamental elements that assist users in bettering their physical condition and set it apart from other apps currently on the market. Diet services can provide more than just calorie counting, food intake monitoring, and physical activity tracking. In addition, it offers food diaries, diet tracking, a health activity tracker, and diet plans for pregnancy, bodybuilding, and veganism. Even if the main goal was to design an app for a diet plan with proper nutrition, the platform must be adaptable to future changes and the addition of new features.
